# 📊 Week 1: Introduction to Statistics

Welcome to **Week 1** of the *Statistical Thinking for Humanities Scholars and Introduction to Statistics for All of You* course! This week, we begin our journey by understanding what statistics is, why it matters, and how we encounter different types of data in real life — especially with examples from our region, **Vidarbha (Maharashtra)**.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Define **statistics** and its two main branches.
- Explain the importance of statistics in everyday life.
- Classify data as **qualitative** or **quantitative**.
- Differentiate between **discrete** and **continuous** quantitative data.
- Relate statistics to real-life examples from the **Vidarbha region**.

## 🔍 What is Statistics?

**Statistics** is the science of:
- Collecting
- Organizing
- Analyzing
- Interpreting data

We use it to **make decisions**, **solve problems**, and **understand trends** in various fields.

## 📘 Branches of Statistics

| Type                 | Description                                           | Example (Vidarbha Context)                         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Descriptive**      | Summarizes data using numbers, graphs, tables         | Average cotton yield per acre in Wardha            |
| **Inferential**      | Makes predictions/inferences from a sample            | Survey 100 farmers in Yavatmal to estimate fertilizer use in all of Vidarbha |

## 📌 Why Is Statistics Important?

**Applications in Vidarbha**:
- 📈 **Agriculture**: Estimating soybean yields in Akola.
- 🏥 **Health**: Tracking dengue cases in Nagpur.
- 🎓 **Education**: Understanding dropout rates in Melghat tribal schools.
- 🌦️ **Weather**: Predicting rainfall in Buldhana.
- 🗳️ **Governance**: Estimating voter turnout in Gram Panchayat elections.

## 🧩 Types of Data

### A. Qualitative (Categorical) Data:
- Describes qualities or categories.
- Cannot be measured numerically.

**Examples**:
- Type of soil: black, red, laterite.
- Favorite local snack: Zunka-Bhakar, Poha, Misal.
- Religion or caste.

### B. Quantitative (Numerical) Data:
- Can be measured and expressed in numbers.

#### 1. Discrete Data (Countable):
- Number of family members.
- Number of cows in a farm.
- Solar panels installed in a village.

#### 2. Continuous Data (Measurable on a scale):
- Daily temperature in Chandrapur in May.
- Rainfall in mm during monsoon in Amravati.
- Weight of a pumpkin harvested in Wardha.

## 🧠 Classroom Activities

### ✅ Activity 1: Statistics Around Us
- Bring a local newspaper article (e.g., Lokmat, Sakal).
- Identify data types: descriptive or inferential?
- Discuss how the data helps us make decisions.

### ✅ Activity 2: Classroom Survey
- Collect data from classmates:
  - Favorite subject
  - Number of siblings
  - Commute time to school
- Categorize each: qualitative/quantitative, discrete/continuous.

### ✅ Activity 3: Sorting Cards (Vidarbha Examples)
Create index cards with the following:
- “Height of a student from Amravati”
- “Type of irrigation in a Wardha farm”
- “Number of mobile towers in Chandrapur”
- “Air pollution level in Nagpur in December”

Students classify each as:
- Qualitative or Quantitative?
- If quantitative: Discrete or Continuous?

## 💡 Think & Reflect

- Why would a farmer in Vidarbha need to understand averages?
- How can a local journalist use statistics effectively?
- What kind of data could your school collect for improvement?
