# 📊 Chapter 1: Introduction to Statistics

Welcome to **Chapter 1** of the *Statistical Thinking for Humanities Scholars* course!  
This chapter begins your journey into the world of statistics — a vital tool for understanding data, recognizing patterns, and making informed decisions, especially in the context of humanities and the Vidarbha region.

## 🧠 Everyday Statistical Thinking: Priors, Bias & Instinct

Before we even get into technical concepts, it's important to understand:  
**You already reason statistically — every day.**

- “This street seems unsafe — I won’t walk here.”
- “That person looks suspicious.”
- “People like him always behave that way.”

These instincts may feel natural, but they are often shaped by **priors** — past experiences, learned biases, media, and societal conditioning.

### 🖼️ Classroom Prompt: Who Looks Like a Criminal?

![Who looks like a criminal?](https://github.com/kwankhede/Statistical-Thinking-for-Humanities-Scholars/blob/main/chapter1.1.png)

> **Ask your students:**  
> “Which of these two individuals looks more like they have a criminal record?”  
> “Why do you think so?”  
> “Are you judging based on facts or instinct?”

⚠️ **Important Note**: Neither individual in this image has a criminal record. This is a thought experiment to uncover our unconscious biases.

This exercise introduces:
- How **data and images** affect our thinking.
- The importance of **evidence over assumption**.
- The role of **critical thinking and statistical reasoning** in challenging our priors.

## 🔍 What is Statistics?

**Statistics** is the science (and art) of:
- **Collecting** data
- **Organizing** it clearly
- **Analyzing** it to find patterns
- **Interpreting** it to make decisions

It helps us understand the world by turning raw data into useful knowledge.

> “You are bombarded with numbers every day. What do these numbers mean?”  
> - 30% chance of rain tomorrow  
> - NCP polling 32% in elections (±5% margin of error)  
> - COVID-19 fatality rate of 1.5% in India  

Without context and interpretation, numbers are meaningless.

## 📘 Statistics: A Science and an Art

- **Science**: Uses mathematical tools and models to analyze data.
- **Art**: Requires human judgment—knowing what questions to ask, which data to trust, and what to ignore.

> *Example (Vidarbha)*: A farmer in Wardha collects data on cotton yield and rainfall. This helps them choose the best sowing time and crop variety.

## 🗃️ What is Data?

**Data** is a collection of facts — numbers, names, characters, or measurements.

- In **small amounts**, we can analyze it by hand.
- In **large amounts**, data must be organized and processed using statistical methods.

> *Imaginary Example:*  
> Dataset of Std. X children in Wardha:  
> `Sex | Height (cm) | Weight (kg)`  
> `F | 150.2 | 45.3`  
> `M | 160.0 | 60.1`

### ⚠️ But data can be **noisy or messy**:
- Errors like `@40.997`, `#45.106` show up.
- Some entries are corrupted and must be cleaned or discarded.

**Cleaning data** includes:
- Removing errors or invalid symbols
- Estimating missing values (e.g., assume average height range)
- Assigning uncertainty (e.g., ± 0.1 cm)

## 📘 Branches of Statistics

| Branch               | Description                                           | Example (Vidarbha Context)                         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Descriptive**      | Summarizes data using numbers, graphs, tables         | Avg. cotton yield per acre in Wardha               |
| **Inferential**      | Predicts/infer from a small sample to a larger group  | Survey of 100 farmers in Yavatmal to estimate fertilizer usage in Vidarbha |

## 📌 Why Is Statistics Important?

**Applications in Vidarbha**:
- 📈 **Agriculture**: Estimate yields in Akola.
- 🏥 **Health**: Track dengue or malnutrition in Nagpur/Melghat.
- 🎓 **Education**: Analyze dropout trends in tribal schools.
- 🌦️ **Weather**: Rainfall forecasts in Buldhana.
- 🗳️ **Governance**: Voter turnout in rural Gram Panchayats.

## 🧩 Types of Data

### A. **Qualitative (Categorical) Data**
- Describes categories or groups (not measured numerically).
- **Examples**:
  - Soil type: black, red
  - Favorite food: Poha, Misal
  - Religion or caste identity

### B. **Quantitative (Numerical) Data**
- Measured with numbers, can be analyzed mathematically.

#### 1. **Discrete** (Countable)
- Number of siblings
- Cows owned by a farmer
- Solar panels in a village

#### 2. **Continuous** (Measured on a scale)
- Temperature in Chandrapur in May
- Daily rainfall in mm
- Height or weight of students

## 🎯 What Is a Statistical Question?

- Has no single fixed answer.
- Involves a **distribution** of answers.

| Example                              | Type                |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| “How tall are you?”                  | Not statistical     |
| “How tall are students in Wardha?”   | Statistical         |
| “What is the average height range of Std. X students in Vidarbha?” | Statistical |

## 💬 Think & Reflect

- Why should a farmer or a teacher learn statistics?
- What kinds of data do you encounter daily in your community?
- What makes a number meaningful? (Hint: Confidence + Context)
- Can your **priors** be wrong? How would you know?

## 📚 Homework/Practice

1. Interview 5 people and collect:
   - Age, gender, and favorite local food
2. Classify the data: Qualitative or Quantitative? Discrete or Continuous?
3. Think of one **assumption** you have — where did it come from? Is it backed by evidence?
