## 🔍 What is Statistics?

**Statistics** is the science of:
- Collecting
- Organizing
- Analyzing  (Finding pattern) 
- Interpreting data

We use it to **make decisions**, **solve problems**, and **understand trends** in various fields.

**Example :** A farmer in Wardha collects data on rainfall and cotton yield each year. By summarizing this data, they can decide the best month to sow seeds and which crop variety gives better yield

## 📘 Branches of Statistics

| Type                 | Description                                           | Example (Vidarbha Context)                         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Descriptive**      | Summarizes data using numbers, graphs, tables         | Average cotton yield per acre in Wardha            |
| **Inferential**      | Makes predictions/inferences from a sample            | Survey 100 farmers in Yavatmal to estimate fertilizer use in all of Vidarbha |

## 📌 Why Is Statistics Important?

**Applications in Vidarbha**:
- 📈 **Agriculture**: Estimating soybean yields in Akola.
- 🏥 **Health**: Tracking dengue cases in Nagpur.
- 🎓 **Education**: Understanding dropout rates in Melghat tribal schools.
- 🌦️ **Weather**: Predicting rainfall in Buldhana.
- 🗳️ **Governance**: Estimating voter turnout in Gram Panchayat elections.

## 🧩 Types of Data

### A. Qualitative (Categorical) Data:
- Describes qualities or categories.
- Cannot be measured numerically.

**Examples**:
- Type of soil: black, red, laterite.
- Favorite local snack: Zunka-Bhakar, Poha, Misal.
- Religion or caste.

### B. Quantitative (Numerical) Data:
- Can be measured and expressed in numbers.

#### 1. Discrete Data (Countable):
- Number of family members.
- Number of cows in a farm.
- Solar panels installed in a village.

#### 2. Continuous Data (Measurable on a scale):
- Daily temperature in Chandrapur in May.
- Rainfall in mm during monsoon in Amravati.
- Weight of a pumpkin harvested in Wardha.
