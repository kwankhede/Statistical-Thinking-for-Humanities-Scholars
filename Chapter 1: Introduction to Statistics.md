# 📊 Chapter 1: Introduction to Statistics

Welcome to **Chapter 1** of the *Statistical Thinking for Humanities Scholars* course!  
This chapter begins your journey into the world of statistics — a vital tool for understanding data, recognizing patterns, and making informed decisions, especially in the context of humanities studies and projects.

<br>

### 🧠 Everyday Statistical Thinking: Priors, Bias & Instinct

Before we even get into technical concepts, it's important to understand:

**You already reason statistically — every day, even without realizing it.**

Here are some everyday examples:

- **“It’s cloudy today — it might rain like yesterday, better carry an umbrella.”**  
  → Based on experience with weather patterns in your area.

- **“That lane usually has stray dogs — I’ll avoid it in the evening.”**  
  → A decision made from repeated observations.

- **“This doctor is always busy — they must be good.”**  
  → You’re associating popularity with quality based on observed trends.

- **“Buses from this stop are always late — I’ll leave 10 minutes earlier.”**  
  → Using prior patterns to plan your action.

These decisions are based on **past experiences**, **observed frequencies**, and **gut feeling** — what statisticians call **priors**.

> **Priors are useful, but they can also lead to biases if we’re not careful.**

<br>

### 🧠 What is Instinct?

**Instinct** is a fast, emotional, or automatic reaction. It often comes from your body’s built-in survival system — and is tied closely to your priors.

- **“That group of people looks suspicious — I’ll avoid them.”**  
  → A decision made instantly, often without conscious reasoning.

Instinct helps us react quickly, but it's not always based on evidence or fairness.

<br>

### 🚨 What is Bias?

**Bias** is when your prior beliefs or instincts consistently lead you to **unfair** or **inaccurate** judgments.

Examples from the Indian context:

- **“People from tribal areas aren’t serious about education.”**  
  → Ignores systemic challenges and generalizes unfairly.

- **“Only English-medium students succeed in exams.”**  
  → Overlooks success stories from rural and vernacular backgrounds.

- **“Boys are naturally better at maths than girls.”**  
  → A stereotype, not supported by actual data.

> Bias is often unconscious — but its effects can be very real.

<br>

### 🖼️ Question: Who Looks Like a Criminal?

![Who looks like a criminal?](https://github.com/kwankhede/Statistical-Thinking-for-Humanities-Scholars/blob/main/media/chapter1.1.png)

> “Which of these two individuals looks more like they have a criminal record?”  
> “Why do you think so?”  
> “Are you judging based on facts or instinct?”

**Important Note**: Neither individual in this image has a criminal record.  
This is a thought experiment to uncover how **bias and instinct** shape judgment.

<br>

### ⚠️ When Priors Might Be Wrong

Sometimes, priors can mislead us:

- **“People from this village always fail exams — why bother teaching them?”**  
  → Based on an outdated or biased sample.

- **“Girls are not good at math.”**  
  → A harmful prior based on stereotypes, not real data.

- **“If I didn’t get sick last time I drank tap water, it must be safe.”**  
  → A risky assumption that ignores invisible dangers.

> **Priors become dangerous when they are based on limited, biased, or outdated information.**

<br>

### 💬 Reflect

- Can you think of a time your assumption or “gut feeling” was wrong?
- What would better data or evidence have shown instead?
- How can we challenge harmful or misleading priors?

<br>

## 🔁 From Priors to False Dichotomies

As we’ve seen, **priors** — beliefs formed through personal experience, observation, or social messaging — help us make quick decisions.

But priors can become problematic when we treat them as **absolutes** — as if they represent the full truth of every situation.  
This leads us to a common mistake in reasoning: the **false dichotomy**.

<br>

### ❗️Understanding False Dichotomies

One common error in both everyday and statistical thinking is assuming **only two possibilities** — this is called a **false dichotomy**.

### 🔍 What is a False Dichotomy?

A **false dichotomy** simplifies a complex situation into two extreme options, ignoring everything in between.

> “Either you're with us, or you're against us.”  
> “This data is either correct or useless.”  
> “A village is either modern or backward.”

In reality, most situations fall on a **spectrum** — not into boxes.


<br>

![False Dichotomy vs. Spectrum](https://ozchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/binary-spectrum-thinking2.png)

<br>

### 🧪 Real-Life Examples

| Statement | Why It’s a False Dichotomy |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| “This person must either be guilty or innocent.” | Reality involves evidence, trial, and uncertainty. |
| “Students either love math or hate it.” | Many have mixed feelings or change over time. |
| “If data isn’t perfect, it’s useless.” | Imperfect data can still provide meaningful insights. |

<br>

### 🌾 More Examples

| Situation | False Dichotomy | What’s the Reality? |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| Crop success in Yavatmal | “The crop either failed or succeeded.” | There can be partial yield, mixed results. |
| Education in Melghat | “A student either drops out or completes school.” | Many students attend irregularly or migrate seasonally. |
| Weather in Buldhana | “It will either rain or not rain.” | There's usually a forecast with percentage likelihood. |

<br>

### 💬  For Studnets 

> “Can you recall a time when you were told to choose between two options, but felt there were more?”  
> - Think of local examples.  
> - Re-frame them into **spectrums**.  
> - Write or draw your version of a “third option.”

<br>

### 🧠 Why It Matters in Statistics

**False dichotomies block good reasoning.**  
They lead to bad survey questions, poor interpretation, and narrow conclusions.

**Statistics helps us:**
- Embrace complexity and nuance
- Think in terms of **range**, **variation**, and **probability**
- Make better decisions based on **evidence**, not assumption

### 📊 What is Statistics?

**Statistics** is the science (and art) of:

* **Collecting** data
* **Organizing** it clearly
* **Analyzing** it to find patterns
* **Interpreting** it to make decisions

It helps us turn raw information into **useful knowledge** for real-life decisions.

> 📺 *“You are bombarded with numbers every day. What do they mean?”*
>
> * 30% chance of rain tomorrow
> * NCP polling 32% in elections (±5% margin of error)
> * COVID-19 fatality rate of 1.5% in India

---

### 📘 Statistics: A Science and an Art

* **Science**: Uses math, formulas, and software to study data.
* **Art**: Requires judgment — what to include, what to ignore, and how to communicate results meaningfully.

> *Example (Vidarbha)*: A farmer in Wardha tracks rainfall and yield to decide when to sow cotton — this is both scientific (data-driven) and intuitive (based on experience).

---

### 💡 Why Learn Statistics?

It’s not just numbers — it helps us **make better decisions** in every field:

| Area          | Local Example                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 📈 Farming    | Fertilizer comparisons in Akola               |
| 🏥 Health     | Dengue and malnutrition tracking in Melghat   |
| 🎓 Education  | Literacy and dropout analysis in tribal areas |
| 🌧️ Climate   | Rain forecasts in Buldhana                    |
| 🗳️ Elections | Voter turnout trends in Gram Panchayats       |

---

### 🎯 What Is a Statistical Question?

A **statistical question** involves variability and requires data to answer.

| Example                                    | Is it Statistical? |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| “How tall are you?”                        | ❌ No               |
| “What is the average height in Wardha?”    | ✅ Yes              |
| “How do test scores vary across Vidarbha?” | ✅ Yes              |

> If the answer could vary and needs multiple data points — it’s a statistical question!

---

### 📘 Branches of Statistics

| Branch          | Description                                     | Example (Vidarbha)                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Descriptive** | Summarizes data using graphs, tables, averages  | Cotton yield in Wardha                         |
| **Inferential** | Makes predictions from a sample to a population | Survey 100 farmers in Yavatmal to infer trends |

#### 🧠 Descriptive Statistics includes:

* Measures of central tendency: **Mean**, **Median**, **Mode**
* Charts: **Bar graphs**, **Pie charts**, **Histograms**
* Tables: **Frequency distributions**, **cross-tabulations**

> Descriptive statistics help you make sense of large amounts of raw data. They give you a clear picture of "what is" without making assumptions or predictions.

#### 🧠 Inferential Statistics includes:

* **Estimating population parameters** using sample statistics
* **Confidence intervals** to express uncertainty around estimates
* **Hypothesis testing** to determine if observed effects are statistically significant
* **Regression analysis** to understand relationships between variables

> Descriptive = *Describe what we have.*
> Inferential = *Use what we have to say something bigger.*

### 🗃️ What is Data?

**Data** refers to facts, figures, and other evidence gathered through observation.
It could be **numbers**, **names**, **measurements**, or **labels**.

#### 🔍 Types of Raw Data:

* Numbers in a survey
* Observations in a classroom
* Entries in a health register

---

### 🗂️ Types of Data: Categorical vs. Numerical

| Type                          | Description                                  | Local Examples                                 |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Categorical** (Qualitative) | Describes categories or labels (not numbers) | Soil type (black/red), village names, religion |
| **Numerical** (Quantitative)  | Measured or counted data in number form      | Income, temperature, number of classrooms      |

> Categorical = *Labels/Groups* — no mathematical meaning.
> Numerical = *Numbers* — used in calculations.

---

#### 📊 Example Dataset:

| Name  | Gender | Height (cm) | Weight (kg) |
| ----- | ------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| Ravi  | M      | 150.2       | 45.3        |
| Meena | F      | 160.0       | 60.1        |

#### ⚠️ Why Raw Data Needs Cleaning:

Before analysis, data often needs:

* **Removing symbols or errors** (e.g., #160, @weight)
* **Dealing with missing values** (e.g., no height mentioned)
* **Estimating uncertainty** (e.g., height = 160 ± 0.5 cm)

> Clean data = Trustworthy results.

### 🔢 Discrete vs. Continuous Data

**Numerical data** is divided into two types: **Discrete** and **Continuous**.

| Type           | Definition                                    | Examples (Local Context)                        |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Discrete**   | Countable whole number values                 | Number of students in a class, cows in a farm   |
| **Continuous** | Measurable quantities that can take any value | Height of students, rainfall in mm, crop weight |

#### 🧠 More examples:

* **Discrete**: Number of trees planted during a campaign, total siblings, buses on a route
* **Continuous**: Temperature in Nagpur during summer, distance walked in km, weight of harvested onions

> Discrete = "How many?" — countable
> Continuous = "How much?" — measurable

---

### 👥 Populations and Samples

| Term           | Definition                                 | Example                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Population** | Entire group you want to study             | All school-going children in Chandrapur    |
| **Sample**     | A small group selected from the population | 200 students from 10 schools in Chandrapur |

#### Why Sampling?

* It’s often not practical to study every individual.
* A sample helps us make **inferences** about the whole population.

> Good sampling = more accurate and reliable conclusions.

### 📋 Sampling Methods and Survey Bias

| Sampling Method   | Description                                | Example                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Simple Random** | Everyone has an equal chance               | Pick names from a bowl or lottery                      |
| **Stratified**    | Divide into groups, sample from each group | Sample equal number of boys and girls from every grade |
| **Systematic**    | Select every *k*th person                  | Every 10th voter in a booth                            |
| **Convenience**   | Select easiest to reach (⚠️ biased)        | Only students from one tuition center                  |

#### ⚠️ Survey Bias Can Occur If:

* You ignore certain groups (e.g., only survey online users)
* The question is confusing or leading
* People refuse to respond (non-response bias)

> Always ask: "Does this sample truly represent the whole population?"
