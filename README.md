Statistical Thinking for Humanities Scholars and Introduction to Statistics for All of You
Welcome to the Statistical Thinking for Humanities Scholars and Introduction to Statistics for All of You course for high school students! This syllabus outlines a semester-long course designed to introduce the fundamentals of statistics in an engaging and accessible way, with applications relevant to humanities and beyond.

Course Overview
Course Title: Statistical Thinking for Humanities Scholars and Introduction to Statistics for All of You
Target Audience: High School Students (Grades 9–12)
Duration: One Semester (12–16 weeks)
Prerequisites: Basic algebra (e.g., solving equations, working with fractions and percentages)
Description: This course introduces students to statistical thinking, focusing on collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data to make informed decisions. Through real-world examples, hands-on activities, and tools like Google Sheets, students will learn to summarize data, understand variability, and explore relationships between variables.
Course Objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to:

Understand the role of statistics in everyday life and decision-making.
Collect, organize, and summarize data using tables, charts, and numerical measures.
Interpret and create visual representations of data (e.g., histograms, bar graphs).
Calculate and interpret measures of central tendency and variability.
Explore relationships between variables using scatterplots and basic correlation concepts.
Understand the basics of probability and its connection to statistics.
Recognize common pitfalls in data collection and interpretation (e.g., bias, misleading graphs).
Apply statistical concepts to real-world scenarios through projects and activities.
Weekly Syllabus

Week	Topics	Activities	Outcomes
1	Introduction to Statistics
- What is statistics? (Descriptive vs. inferential)
- Importance in real life (e.g., sports, polls)
- Types of data: qualitative vs. quantitative, discrete vs. continuous	- Discuss statistics in media (e.g., election polls, sports stats)
- Collect and classify classroom data (e.g., favorite hobbies)	- Define statistics and its applications
- Distinguish between types of data
2	Data Collection and Sampling
- Populations vs. samples
- Sampling methods: random, stratified, convenience
- Bias in data collection	- Conduct a class survey (e.g., favorite music genre)
- Discuss biased sampling effects	- Differentiate population and sample
- Identify sources of bias
3	Organizing and Visualizing Data
- Frequency tables and distributions
- Bar graphs, pie charts, histograms
- Misleading graphs	- Create frequency tables and bar graphs from survey data
- Analyze misleading media graphs	- Organize data into tables and charts
- Critique visual data representations
4	Measures of Central Tendency
- Mean, median, mode
- When to use each measure
- Impact of outliers	- Calculate measures for class data (e.g., test scores)
- Explore outlier effects on mean vs. median	- Compute and interpret central tendency measures
- Understand outlier effects
5	Measures of Variability
- Range, interquartile range (IQR), standard deviation (conceptual)
- Importance of variability	- Calculate range and IQR for a dataset
- Discuss data spread using simple examples	- Describe data variability
- Compute basic measures of spread
6	Introduction to Probability
- Basic probability concepts (0 to 1 scale)
- Simple probability rules
- Simulations for probabilities	- Conduct coin-flip or dice-rolling experiments
- Discuss real-world examples (e.g., weather forecasts)	- Calculate basic probabilities
- Use simulations to understand probability
7	Probability and Statistics Connection
- Random sampling and probability
- Expected value (basic)
- Law of large numbers (intuitive)	- Simulate random sampling with dice or cards
- Discuss why larger samples are more reliable	- Understand probability’s role in statistics
- Explain importance of sample size
8	Exploring Relationships Between Variables
- Scatterplots and patterns
- Correlation (conceptual)
- Causation vs. correlation	- Create scatterplots (e.g., height vs. shoe size)
- Discuss correlation vs. causation (e.g., ice cream sales and drowning)	- Interpret scatterplots
- Distinguish correlation from causation
9	Introduction to Statistical Inference
- Inferential statistics concepts
- Margin of error and confidence intervals (intuitive)
- Polls and surveys	- Analyze a real-world poll
- Simulate confidence intervals with class data	- Understand inferential statistics
- Interpret poll results and margins of error
10	Hypothesis Testing (Simplified)
- What is a hypothesis?
- Statistical significance (intuitive)
- Testing claims with data	- Test a hypothesis using class data (e.g., average homework time)
- Discuss real-world examples (e.g., drug testing)	- Formulate and test hypotheses
- Understand statistical significance conceptually
11–12	Data Analysis Project
- Applying concepts to a real-world dataset
- Summarizing data, creating visuals, drawing conclusions
- Presenting findings	- Analyze a dataset (e.g., sports stats, school survey)
- Create a poster or presentation	- Apply statistical tools to data
- Communicate findings effectively
13–14	Special Topics and Applications
- Statistics in sports, social media, or ethics (based on interest)	- Analyze a fun dataset (e.g., movie ratings)
- Discuss ethical data use	- Explore real-world applications
- Understand ethical considerations
15–16	Review and Final Assessment
- Review key concepts
- Prepare for final assessment	- Play review games (e.g., statistics jeopardy)
- Present final projects or take a quiz	- Demonstrate mastery of concepts
- Apply statistics to solve problems
