## üìò Course Overview

- **Course Title**: Statistical Thinking for Humanities Scholars and Introduction to Statistics for All of You  
- **Target Audience**: High School Students (Grades 9‚Äì12)  
- **Duration**: One Semester (12‚Äì16 weeks)  
- **Prerequisites**: Basic algebra (e.g., solving equations, working with fractions and percentages)

**Description**:  
This course introduces students to statistical thinking, focusing on collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data to make informed decisions. Through real-world examples, hands-on activities, and tools like Google Sheets, students will learn to summarize data, understand variability, and explore relationships between variables.

## üéØ Course Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Understand the role of statistics in everyday life and decision-making.
- Collect, organize, and summarize data using tables, charts, and numerical measures.
- Interpret and create visual representations of data (e.g., histograms, bar graphs).
- Calculate and interpret measures of central tendency and variability.
- Explore relationships between variables using scatterplots and basic correlation concepts.
- Understand the basics of probability and its connection to statistics.
- Recognize common pitfalls in data collection and interpretation (e.g., bias, misleading graphs).
- Apply statistical concepts to real-world scenarios through projects and activities.
